            They need to think about grammar rules and make mistakes takes when speaking. They forget new vocabulary and have trouble finding the right words to say in conversations. They're often not understood because of their poor pronunciation or use of incorrect words.

            And they sometimes don't understand the fast speech, difficult accents or conversational vocabulary of native English speakers. Over time, these lead to a loss of confidence, a fear of speaking, and many missed opportunities. So why do so many learners experience these problems and never become successful communicators? It's because of how they learn English from their very first lesson.

            Nonnative beginners study English the traditional way they learn English through their native language, so they translate words and phrases instead of understanding their meanings directly. They're introduced to new words and grammar rules with textbooks, but aren't trained to remember and use what they learn without hesitation. When they speak.

            <br>
            They study the formal English appropriate for writing, but not the slang, idioms and cultural references found in actual conversations. They rarely practice speaking and because they only hear slow, clear English in listening practice exercises, they never develop smooth pronunciation or the ears to understand fast native speakers. Intermediate students who have only learned to read, write and understand slow, clear speakers try to teach themselves conversational English with TV shows, movies, podcasts and music.
