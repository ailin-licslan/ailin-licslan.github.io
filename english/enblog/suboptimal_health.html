            Hi,Lisa, And my name is x, You know, I'm not really feeling great today.
            I'm feeling a bit slow, My brain is not really working that well, I feel like
            maybe I'm not really healthy.
            Maybe you have a case of suboptimal health?
            well, that's interesting because that's we're talking about today.
            So in today lesson, we've got two people : a doctor and Karen,Now Karen much like
            x isn't really feeling so great, but she doesn't know what's wrong with her.
            Let's see if the doctor can fix Karen's problem and mine.
            <br>
            <br>
            <span>Hello,Karen, What seems to be the problem?</span>
            <br>
            <span>Hey,Doc, I'm not exactly sure, but I've been really sluggish lately.</span>
            <br>
            <span>Have you been getting enough sleep?</span>
            <br>
            <span>Definitely not, I think I have insomnia which often leaves me feeling irritable and
            achy.</span>
            <br>
            <span>Sounds like we might have a case of suboptimal health here, It's usually
            characterized by persistent fatigue, and recurrent non-specific pain.
            Sound about right, Any clue as to what set it off?</span>
            <br>
            <span>It could be many things, but the ailments you're experiencing are often caused by
            excessive stress, and nutritional deficiency, which typically result in imbalance.</span>
            <br>
            <span>Well, things have been pretty out of whack,Any tips as to what I can do?</span>
            <br>
            <span>Start with some lifestyle changes,A stricter dietary regimen always helps, Moderate
            aerobic exercise and meditation can also improve your sleep.</span>
            <br>
            <span>Got it, Is 150 minutes per week of exercise enough?</span>
            <br>
            <span>Yup, but more will help optimize your health. Let's run a few tests, so I can give
            you an accurate prognosis.</span>
