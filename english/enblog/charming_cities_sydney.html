            The metropolis of Sydney is a wonderland of unique experience bursting with beauty.
            <br>
            Nestled between beaches and national parks,Sydneysiders enjoy many natural attractions.
            <br>
            As one of the most livable cities in the world, millions of international tourists
            travel down under every year.
            <br>
            It's no secret that Sydney is picturesque - anyone can recognize the iconic Sydney
            Open House.
            <br>
            But its thriving economy and vibrant yet laid-back culture make it perfect for
            anyone's tastes.
            <br>
            Speaking of tastes, Sydney is known fot its wine, seafood, coffee experts, and
            avocado on toast!
            <br>
            Although Sydney is synonymous with sun-bathed beaches like Bondi or Manly Beach, it's
            also home to a rich and sensitive ecology.
            <br>
            Western Sydney Parklands has a unique biodiversity of flora and fauna, which the city
            is fighting to keep pristine.
            <br>
            Sydney's majestic coastline is full of marine species, and Sydney Harbor National
            Park is a great place to drink it all in. Just whatever you do, don't forget your
            sunscreen!
