            Hey Luke, you look a bit jittery today. How many coffees have you had?
            Honestly, I can't say.I lost count after the 5th.
            <br>
            Sounds like someone has a caffeine addiction.Don't you think it's time for an
            intervention? It is a drug after all.
            <br>
            It's a mild stimulant! Besides, it helps me focus, and that dopamine rush keeps me alert
            and motivated. It also improves long-term memory.
            <br>
            If you say so, but you do crash a lot, and I know you have insomnia. Have you ever
            gone on a hiatus?
            <br>
            Once. I quit cold turkey and had all the classic withdrawal symptoms: headaches,
            irritability, and fatigue.
            <br>
            Maybe switch to decaf. At least it'll act like a placebo, and you'll be less likely to
            relapse.
            <br>
            Yeah,drinking lots of water and alternative stimulants like exercise and supposed to
            help too.
            <br>
            Seriously.Try it for a month,and you'll feel revitalized after.
            Oh, all right! I'll think about it, but no promises!
            <br>
