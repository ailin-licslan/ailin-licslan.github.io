            I live in wuhan china, a small village, i love my family even though it is the time of
            lacking resources and technology, i still have lots of happiness to share with my family
            and friends. i write this blog try to use in english all for practicing english and to
            improve my english writing skills
            I know it is a little bit of difficulty for me using in english and even will make a
            lots of mistakes in writing but i do not care, i just want to use english all of my
            life.
            The english studying it is part of my life, after i knowing that, the people life it
            is a process of growing up, so i want to do something it is different compare to
            other people who are same age as me, what is
            the purpose of living in the world? in china, for parents for family for children
            and so on … it's a little bit tried of living this world for all the responsibilities.
            We are talk about language learning, i am poor code programmer cause i still have lost
            more to learn, i have been studying java scala python and go, in fact, there are some
            reasons for my learning those program languages.

            <hr>
            The first one is high salary，secondly is the big data use those languages will
            be more effective, i want to do some interesting and amazing things, using more data to
            analysis and get more usefully data to apply in life … Although it is far away for me,
            i have no chance to use my knowledge to deal with those data, so in one day, i hope i
            could work in ByteDance/Alibaba or some great company like that, yes i did not have good
            education and not go to a good University, but i think the most good university it is
            our self, the ability to using internet to study the subject you interest in and KEEP
            DOING one thing you want to do in the world unless you are not living the world!

            <hr>
            Just like Steve Jobs once said 'Stay Hungry Stay Foolish', we live this world just for
            doing something instead of doing nothing, i want doing something, some interesting
            things some things that can implements our work and dreams.
            Finding one thing you are interest in and try to achieve it. to be a good man and helping
            other people under your ability. it is learn from the movie PAY IT FORWARD to help more
            people do the better self
            Of course I want to travel around the world But lack of money (^_^ a big smile here)
            YES we are young we need to do more crazy things with young age and some crazy things in
            other eyes even just only yourself, cause the lonely person can go faster but you
            still need some good people go with you before you did not meet those guys so just by
            yourself to those Journey
            Sometimes my opinion is different between the same ages of my friends, it is odd,it is
            not traditionally, thank myself it is me, is the person of WeiLin Huang, it is real
            me. i want to do myself, sometimes you can not. with worldly life to live … common
            customs to move our steps. it is sucks. you have no chance to change it.
            Try to be good to you family try to love your parents and friends, try to cherish your
            time to do right things, try to find your other half, your right girl… I TRY TO DO IT
