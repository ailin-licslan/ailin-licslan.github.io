                1.How often do you use social media? Which platforms do you use?
                <p>I use social media every day, especially WeChat and Weibo, I use WeChat to
                contact my family and friends,What i like the most about WeChat is that i can
                send voice messages and make video calls anytime, anywhere, I post regularly,
                about once a week or so, on Weibo. It helps me to keep track of the memorable
                moments of my life. I also followed some news accounts to keep me informed every
                    day.</p>
                2.Do you make friends online ?
                <p>Making friends isn't easy for everyone.However,if you find the right
                    community,it's much easier to meet people who share the same interests, I
                    made a good friend online because we both love movies,We often share the
                    latest movie news with each other,And we've actually scheduled a couple of
                    movie night offline.Although we don't see each other very often, we really
                    have a lot of fun together,And I consider her to be a real friend because
                    she really understands me!</p>
                3.Do you like to share your life on social media? Would you share different
                things with different groups of people? Why?
                <p>....</p>
                3.Does browsing social media affect your mod?
