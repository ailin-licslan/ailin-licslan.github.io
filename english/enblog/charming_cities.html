                Yup, Vancouverites are a very eclectic mix of people and everyone is very
                open-minded and welcoming.
                It's true. and with all the fresh mountain air and with the ocean teeming with
                life, what's not to love?
                Ha!, it's no surprise we're always stereotyped as being eco-friendly hippies.
                If someone just saying that people here are very eclectic and they're
                open-minded,That just means people are accepting of new ideas,that can try new
                things and that's what Vancouver is all about,We're a mix of open-minded people,
                and that's one of the reasons Vancouver has such a high livability, the
                livability is just like how enjoyable is it to live in that place.Basically, if a
                place is very livable, it means it's good for living there, not just for traveling.
                So you might read a list about like the ten most livable cities in the world, and
                usually Vancouver, i'm not try to brag, but it's usually in that list, so does
                wuhan ^_^ in china.
                One thing as well: if you do come here, you'll notice all of the mountains, there's
                tons of this fresh mountain air, which is what Lin is talking about here, and the
                ocean, we're on the ocean, and he says this really cool phrase: the ocean is
                teeing with life.
                Okay, so if something's teeming with something, it just means it's filled with
                something, it could be things or people. But often you'll see this phrase
                "teeming whit life", talking about an ocean.we also could use it to talk about
                the streets, like the streets are teeming with tourists.
                because we do all these things, because we do outdoor activities and yoga and
                hang out in the mountains, People of stereotype us as being eco-friendly hippies.
