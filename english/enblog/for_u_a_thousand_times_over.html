            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we were children, Hassan and I used to climb the poplar trees in the
            driveway of
            my father's house and annoy our neighbors by reflecting sunlight into their homes with
            a shard of mirror. We would sit across from each other on a pair of high branches, our
            naked feet dangling, our trouser pockets filled with dried mulberries and walnuts. We
            took turns with the mirror as we are mulberries, pelted each other with them, giggling,
            laughting, I can still see Hassan up on that tree, sunlight flickering through the
            leaves on his almost perfectly round face, a face like a Chinese doll chiseled from
            hardwood: his flat, broad nose and slanting , narrow eyes like bamboo leaves, eyes
            that looked, depending on the light, gold, green, even sapphire. I can still see his
            tiny low-set ears and that pointed stub of a chin, a meaty appendage that looked like
            it was added as mere after thought. And the cleft lip, just left of midline, where
            the Chinese doll maker's instrument may have slipped, or perhaps he had simply grown
            tired and careless.
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes, up in those trees, I talked Hassan into firing walnuts with his slingshot
            at the neighbor's one-eyed German shepherd, Hassan never wanted to, but if I asked,
            really asked, he wouldn't deny me, Hassan never denied me any thing. And hw was
            deadly whit slingshot, Hassan's father, Ali, used to catch us and get mad, or as mad
            as someone gentle as Ali could ever get. He would wag his finger and wave us down
            from the tree, He would take the mirror and tell us what his mother had told him,
            that the devil shone mirrors too, shone them to distract Muslims during prayer. "And
            he laughs while he does it," he always added, scowling at his son.
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Father," Hassan would mumble, looking down at his feet.
            But he never told on me. Never told that the mirror, like shooting walnuts at the
            neighbor's dog, was always my idea.
