            The sandwich generation means that they are in between two other generations.
            Hey,Barb, do you have any daycare recommendations ? we have to find a new one for my
            daughter soon.
            <br>
            Oh, well actually my parents look after the kids while my husband and I are at work.
            I wish that were an option for me.Not only do I have to find a new daycare for my
            daughter,but I have to find a new retirement home for mom,too.
            Oh wow, looks like we've go another sandwicher!
            Excuse me?
            You know.the sandwich generation.Those of us sandwiched between having to take care
            of both our parents and our kids.
            Well I'd be lying if I said we didn't feel the weight of the situation.Plus,my
            parents are completely dead-set against retirement homes. They don't easily square
            with our idea of filial piety(孝道).
            Oh that's right.But it's not like you're abandoning them, I mean a lot of these high-end
            senior living communities are pretty decent places to live.
            I bet they don't come cheap.
            <br>
            Fortunately when my mom downsized a few years ago, we were able to put away a few
            bucks, so that pretty much covers the cost.
            Did your mom help you take care of your children? I heard American grandparents don't
            really do that.
            They are generally not as involved as Chinese grandparents, but many still help out,
            My mom offered to help too, but with her deteriorating health, there wasn't much she
            could really do.
            Well it's good to know I'm not alone.With all of pressure we face, this cohort(同类人群)
            has to stick together.
            You mean like a club sandwich?
            Something like that.
