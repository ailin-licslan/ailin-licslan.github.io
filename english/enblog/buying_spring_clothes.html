            Spring's finally here,V! Speaking of,I need to pick out a few items for my
            wardrobe,Let's go!
            <br>
            What!I thought we came to the mall for food.Can you make it quick?
            Of course,Honey! I even made a list, First up: a trench coat.
            Wait, don't you have one already?
            The one at home is black.I need one in beige to freshen up my look. What do you think?
            Hmm, I like it.
            <br>
            Oh, I also need a couple off-the-shoulder tops.
            Those look way too big for you.
            Well, they're supposed to be loose fitting.Perfect when paired with some skinny jeans.
            If you say so, Isn't spring all about dresses?
            Yeah, it is, But this year they're big on ruffles and bright florals.Not a big fan of
            those trends.
            What about this one?
            Oh,wow.The silhouette is so simple, and I love the pastel color! Let me try it on.
            Amanda, I'm sure you'll look gorgeous in it. You don't even need to try it on.
            Thanks, honey, I'm definitely going with this one. Do you mind if I quickly check out
            the second floor?
            There's a second floor?
