            Home of the world's second-tallest building and other colossal modern
            architectural feats, Shanghai still retains much of that 1920s charm for
            which it is known.
            <br>
            This roaring period left Shanghai with a vast array of art deco buildings,
            many of which are located in the Former French Concession.
            <br>
            And as for home-grown architecture, Shanghai also has many longtang and shikumen homes.
            <br>
            If you're into chowing down on cheap local delicacies, there's plenty of "hole in
            the wall" restaurants to tickle your fancy.
            <br>
            But if swanky fine-dining is more your style, the culinary scene in Shanghai surely
            won't leave you disappointed either.
            <br>
            From soup dumplings and yellow croaker noodles to Michelin restaurants high atop the
            Bund, Shanghai has got it all!
            <br>
            A creative and vibrant city that excites, Shanghai's entertainment options are beyond
            abundant.
            <br>
            During the day, try visiting one of the many contemporary art galleries.
            <br>
            And at night go tap your toes at a cool smoky jazz lounge, mosh at a loud heavey
            metal bar, or dance until sunrise at a hip-hop and EDM club!
