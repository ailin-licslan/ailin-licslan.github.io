            Hey, Bill, Happy Independence Day!
            <br>
            Thanks, Amanda, Happy Fourth of July!
            <br>
            I've always known that the Fourth of July is your national day. But I don't even know
            what year the United States was founded.
            <br>
            It was 1776, when John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, and Thomas Jefferson drafted and
            singed the Declaration of Independence. Those three and a few others, like George
            Washington, are called the Founding Fathers.
            <br>
            Interesting. America was still a part of Great Britain before that, right?
            <br>
            Yep, The U.S, was only composed of thirteen colonies governed by England. They wanted
            to be self-governing. So on that day, they declared themselves a new nation.
            <br>
            Was that the American Revolution?
            <br>
            Not exactly, The American Revolution was set in motion (开始) 10 years before that as
            many Americans grew increasingly intolerant of British rule.
            <br>
            Oh, I see. I've always liked the American flag. It looks very nice.
            <br>
            Yeah, we call it the Star-spangled Banner (星条旗), and each star represents one of the
            50 states. The original only had thirteen stars. Each time a state joined the union,
            they added a star.
            <br>
            What's the movie with Nicolas Cage where he steals that ancient document?
            <br>
            Oh, you mean National Treasure! Yeah, that was the Constitution. It's the supreme law
            of the U.S. To Americans, it's like the bedrock (基石) of their society.
            <br>
            Wow, I can see why it's such a big day for Americans. Thanks for filling me in (解释 说明).
