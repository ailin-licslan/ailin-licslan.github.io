            Hey Noel, is that the British version of The Office you're watching?
            <br>
            Why, yes it is, I much prefer it to the US version.
            <br>
            Yeah, it wasn't bad, but I still prefer the antics(可笑滑稽的举动) of American humor over
            British
            comedy; that dry wit stuff is a bit too subdued. I mean, where's the emotion?
            <br>
            I love it when a comedian uses a an innuendo(讽刺影射) while keeping a straight face;
            has me in stitches(忍不住大笑) every time! So, I take it you don't like satire(讽刺) much then
            either?
            <br>
            Eh, let's just say sarcasm(讽刺) and the mocking(嘲弄) of others isn't my cup of tea.
            <br>
            Good one, Liam. What about dark humor?
            <br>
            You mean like when someone dies at a funeral? Yeah, that's usually pretty good for a
            laugh, especially if there's a nice punchline (引入发笑的台词) at the end. With that said,
            I'm more of a Monty Python kind of guy.
            <br>
            Oh I see, you're more into the absurd (荒谬的) side of British comedy. Well then, I've
            got a joke for you: an Englishman, an lrishman and a Scotsman walk int a pub ...
