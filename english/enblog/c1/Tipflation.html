            The was a wonderful dinner, honey. What do you want to do now?
            <br>
            Well, I'm thinking we should go get a second mortgage after that 25% tip I just left!
            <br>
            25%? What prompted that?
            The machine! its lowest option was 20%. I don't want to seem like a cheapskate.
            <br>
            So this is the tipflation I keep hearing about. They just keep nudging us higher and
            higher.
            <br>
            Not to mention the sticker shock of higher menu prices!
            <br>
            Now that you mention it, if prices have gone up, haven't tips already gone up
            automatically too?
            <br>
            Exactly. It's a double whammy: adding insult to injury!
            <br>
            I think these restaurants should be careful. This might backfire. Other people are
            feeling the pinch these days, too.
            <br>
            I just wish they'd abolish tipping altogether and start paying servers a living wage.
            <br>
            Some restaurants are trying that model out. It might be a while before it catches on
            though.
            <br>
            Well, maybe we should put our money where our mouth is and start frequenting those
            places.
            <br>
            Good idea. If we had any money left after tonight's dinner, that is!
