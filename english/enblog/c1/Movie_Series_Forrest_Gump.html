            In the 1990s, "Forrest Gump" was a runway success, and it still remains one of the
            most quotable movies of all time.
            <br>
            It was also famous for its CGI. Although dated by today's standards, seeing Forrest
            inserted into real historical footage was enough to amaze audiences worldwide.
            <br>
            Forrest is a man who stumbles (蹒跚 结巴) through every monumental (重要的 意义深远的) moment in
            mid-20th century American history, in some cases acting as the catalyst (催化剂
            促成变化的人/事件) for those events.
            <br>
            He even finds himself on the geopolitical (地理政治学的) stage, being part of ping pong
            diplomacy (手腕 手段 策略) in China.
            <br>
            He is oblivious (毫无知觉的 未察觉的) to the upheaval (激变 动荡 剧变) that surrounds him, and his
            lack of cynicism (愤世嫉俗) allows the viewer to see an idealized version of America.
            <br>
            On the surface, "Forrest Gump" might seem like the simple story of a simple man.
            However, it can also be viewed as meditation on destiny versus chance.
            <br>
            Forrest floats through life like the iconic feather that opens and closes the movie,
            whereas the characters who believe in destiny all run into disaster.
            <br>
            Is life a box of chocolates, or is it run by destiny? The film ends with Forrest
            concluding "maybe it's both".
