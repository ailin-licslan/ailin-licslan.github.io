            Hey, Martin, thanks for inviting me over. You've got some cool gadgets(小装置) !
            <br>
            Thanks! I've automated my house with latest smart home products.
            <br>
            Interesting. Not worried about your privacy?
            <br>
            Not at all. Who's gonna hack my fridge? Besides, the convenience outweighs any risk.
            <br>
            Is flicking (轻击) a light switch that inconvenient?
            <br>
            Haha. It's not just about convenience. There are energy savings, home insurance
            discounts, and peace of mind (内心的宁静) when I'm not at home.
            <br>
            Call me old fashioned, but I find the Internet of Things a little too invasive. I
            don't want to run the risk of getting hacked.
            <br>
            I hear you, but for me the only real downside is connectivity. I'm at the mercy of my
            internet connection and its compatibility (兼容性) with other products.
            <br>
            Yeah, fumbling around (笨手笨脚地摸索) with your phone when they don't work is no fun!
            <br>
            And actually, it's a little eerie(可怕的) when I see ads for things I never searched for.
            <br>
            Maybe your fridge is spying on you!
