            What did you think of the movie?
            <br>
            Well, you know, I really think with the horrendous (可怕的) script and flat acting it was probably one of the best movies of
            our generation. I see a lot of Oscar nods in its future!
            <br>
            Wait... what? So...you liked it?
            <br>
            ...no, I'm being sarcastic. It was one of the worst movies I've ever seen.
            <br>
            God, you Americans! I can never tell if you guys are being serious or sarcastic.
            <br>
            Well, it's huge part of American culture, so you better get with the program(入乡随俗) or I don't think I can be friends with you anymore...
            <br>
            ...but
            <br>
            I'M KIDDING!
            <br>
            See?! I'm clueless.
            <br>
            Well, usually we change the pitch and tone of our voices a little when we're being sarcastic, typically speaking a little bit more slowly and with a deeper pitch(音高).
            <br>
            Ok, Why do you Americans lke sarcasm so much anyway? Where I'm from it's seen as super rude.
            <br>
            It's deeply engrained (根深蒂固的) into American culture. I think it may have originally come from British culture. Either way, Americans generally like to joke around a lot.
            This isn't to say that we don't know how tobe serious, but we see small sarcastic jokes like these as a means to brighten everyday life up a little. You can see it reflected everywhere in our culture,
            from small interpersonal interactions to mass media.
            <br>
            I see. Geez, you guys truly are the most evolved culture on the planet...
            <br>
            Well, I wouldn't necessarily go that far.
            <br>
            ... I'm being sarcastic.
            <br>
            Aha!
