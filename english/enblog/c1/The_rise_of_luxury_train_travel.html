            You have to watch this video about the Orient Express (东方快车), It's stunning.(令人惊叹的)
            <br>
            You mean Murder on the Orient Express?
            <br>
            No, no the movie.There's an actual Orient Express from Paris to lstanbul. It's a
            vintage(复古的) luxury train. Look!
            <br>
            Wow, that does look exquisite(精致的,细腻的,优美的). It's like being transported back to the
            1920's.
            <br>
            Isn't it glamorous(华丽的)? Apparently luxury train travel is having its moment now.The
            trains take passengers on multi-day journeys and are slow by design.
            <br>
            Makes sense. You'd be paying a premium(高端的价格,溢价), but with a carriage (车厢) that
            plush(舒适的), you'd want to go slow, so you can relax and soak up the sights.
            <br>
            Absolutely! There's just something so romantic and nostalgic(怀旧的,怀恋的) about traveling
            by train and immersing yourself in the sound of train tracks and crossing bells(汽笛).
            <br>
            It's definitely a multi-sensory experience! And a great way to get a glimpse of what
            each country has to offer.
            <br>
            Not to mention, with all the passengers sharing such an intimate space, I bet a lot
            of great romances were bron on trains.
            <br>
            Yeah, but don't forget about the murders too...
            <br>
            Ah, why do you always have to do that?
