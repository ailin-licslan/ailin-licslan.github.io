            Beijing, one of the four ancient capitals of China, with a rich history dating back
            three millennia, was once a place I called home
            <br>
            My life there started where the city itself started, in the timeless hutongs of old
            Beijing, I lived in a siheyuan, just a stone's throw form the awe-inspiring Forbidden
            City
            <br>
            But Beijing isn't just for history buffs. It's a multifaceted city that's at the
            cutting edge of art and architecture.
            <br>
            This was no more evident than in places like the hip 798 district, or the Beijing
            CBD, home of the jaw-dropping CCTV headquarters
            <br>
            However, for a gastronome like myself, dishes like the iconic Beijing roast duck and
            lamb hotpot really stand out from my time there.
            <br>
            But above all else, it's the people that I remember most fondly.
            <br>
            For some time, I lived near Tsinghua and Peking University, where I crossed paths
            with individuals from all walks of life, including some of China's best and brightest
            minds.
            <br>
            Nowadays, whenever someone asks me if I'd live in Beijing again, I always say the
            same thing: in a heartbeat.
