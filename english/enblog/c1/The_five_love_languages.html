            I'm in the doghouse (惹祸，受冷落) again, Carol. Sometimes it feels like my wife and I are
            speaking
            different languages.
            <br>
            Maybe you are! Have you ever heard of the book called "The Five Love Languages?"
            <br>
            Can't say that I have. What's the basic premise (前提 假定)?
            <br>
            People have different primary love languages they use to express and receive love.
            <br>
            Those being?
            <br>
            Words of affirmation (肯定), quality time, receiving gifts, acts of service, and
            physical touch.
            <br>
            And what have you gleaned (缓慢艰难地收集信息) from it?
            <br>
            My husband needs words of affirmation, which I need to practice giving him because I
            was brought up so differently.
            <br>
            I shower my wife with compliments all the time though!
            <br>
            Maybe for her, actions speak louder than words.
            <br>
            Well, I'm tired of all the bickering (斗嘴 口角). We're both running on empty.
            <br>
            The book says we need to be attuned (心领神会的 熟悉的) to when our partner's "love tank" is
            running low, and then help them fill it up.
            <br>
            Just by speaking their love language?
            <br>
            It's not the be-all and end-all. But it's a starting point for exploring more
            meaningful ways to communicate.
