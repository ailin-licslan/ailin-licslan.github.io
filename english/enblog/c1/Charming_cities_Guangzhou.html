            Guangzhou, situated on the banks of the Pearl River Dalta, has long been one of
            China's main commercial and trading centers.
            <br>
            The City of Five Rams has been a nexus(枢纽) of world trade for centuries, from the
            Maritime(海运的;航海的) Silk Road to the modern Canton Fair.
            <br>
            Indeed, it could be argued that this intermingling(交融;混合) with the world is what has
            led to the openness, pragmatism(实用主义;独断), and inclusiveness(包容;包容性) of the Cantonese
            people.
            <br>
            Indigenous(本土的) lingnan architecture is another sign of Guangzhou pragmatism, a
            design suited for a subtropical(亚热带的) climate.
            <br>
            However, Guangzhou is also home to the dizzyingly-tall Canton Tower, as well as the
            postmodern(后现代的) Guangzhou Opera House.
            <br>
            Cantonese cuisine(菜肴;菜系) is sparsely (稀疏地;清淡地) seasoned (调味的;有经验的,老手) to bring out
            the true character of the food.
            <br>
            Guangzhou migrants (移民) took their culinary (烹饪的;食物的) traditions with them to America
            in the 19th and 20th centuries, forever changing the palate(对美食,美酒的鉴赏力; 味觉) of
            Americans.
            <br>
            Today, you would be hard pressed to find an urban American who had never head of chow
            mein (中国炒面), bok choy (白菜), or of course dim sum(点心).
