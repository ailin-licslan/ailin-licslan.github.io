            The Shawshank Redemption (拯救 救赎) is often called one of the greatest movies of all
            time. But, when it was first released in `94, it was a box office flop (票房毒药)!
            <br>
            However, after getting 7 Academy Awards nominations (提名) and numerous (许多的 大量的)
            accolades (赞赏 荣誉), the prison drama finally found its redemption in its video release.
            <br>
            Based on a book by Stephen King, the film tells the story of Andy Dufresne, a man who
            is wrongly convicted (宣判...有罪) of murder.
            <br>
            Sentenced to life, Andy refuses to give up hope, and works his way up the prison
            ladder as an accountant to the corrupt (adj 腐败的 贪污的 v 使腐烂 使堕落 n 堕落 腐烂) warden and
            guards.
            <br>
            While behind bars (在监狱里) , he uses his clout (权势 影响力) to reform the prison and
            befriends a resigned lifer (无期徒刑) named Red, to whom he becomes a symbol of hope.
            <br>
            The film climaxes when Andy escapes Shawshank and exposes the warden for his
            nefarious (邪恶的 不道德的) deeds.
            <br>
            At its heart, his cinematic masterpiece (著作) is a poignant (酸楚的 深刻的) reflection on
            hope, friendship and the human spirit.
            <br>
            It explores what it means to be human and that tenuous (不确定的 不明确的) relationship
            between hoping too much and too little.
