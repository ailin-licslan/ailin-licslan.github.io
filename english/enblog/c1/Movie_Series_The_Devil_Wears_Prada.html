            The Devil Wears Prada has long been lauded (赞美 赞扬) as "a rare film that surpasses the
            quality of its original work".
            <br>
            Written by Lauren Weisberger, the book draws inspiration from her experiences working
            for the notorious Anna Wintour, Vogue's editor-in-chief.
            <br>
            Although the story remains mostly the same, the film outshines the novel with its
            witty (诙谐的 风趣的) dialogue and star-studded (充满明星大腕的) cast (演员阵容 选角).
            <br>
            In the film, Anne Hathaway plays Andy Sachs, a young college grad who lands a job
            working under the diabolical (糟糕透顶的 恶魔般的) fashion editor, Miranda Priestly.
            <br>
            However, what at first seems like an easy job quickly becomes a living nightmare as
            Andy finds herself at the mercy of (受...支配/所左右) Miranda's whims.
            <br>
            Refusing to give up, Andy learns to navigate the cutthroat world of fashion but finds
            herself losing her true self along the way.
            <br>
            As a rom-com, the film subverts (动摇 颠覆) the usual formula (惯例 模式), focusing more on
            Andy's career path than her romantic relationships.
            <br>
            In the end, Andy realizes that life is all about choices, and some things just aren't
            worth selling your soul.
