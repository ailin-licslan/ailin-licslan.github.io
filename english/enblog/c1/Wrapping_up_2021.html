            Many had hopes that 2021 would bring the end of global pandemic. Instead, we saw new
            variants spread, a market-crippling(市场瘫痪的; 市场严重受损的) global supply shortage, and no
            end in sight.
            <br>
            To make matters worse, climate change got real as extreme heat and wildfires rocked
            the globe.
            <br>
            The WHO declared climate change to be the world's biggest threat. It was an
            existential wake-up call.
            <br>
            But it wasn't all doom and gloom (凄惨 前景不妙). It was also full of uplifting times.
            <br>
            Countries and athletes gathered together for the Tokyo Olympics, A Kidnapped son was
            reunited with his parents after 24 years.
            <br>
            A crew of only civilians(平民) flew into space. A tennis star started a conversation
            about mental health. And the Korean drama "Squid Game" took the world by storm.
            <br>
            And in many ways, it was business as usual, We saw the billionaire space race, the
            GameStop market surge(陡增,剧增) and plenty of lawsuits against Big Tech in the US.
            <br>
            In retrospect(回顾), 2021 was a tough year, but we learned, we grew, and conquered.
            Don't forget hindsight is 2021.
