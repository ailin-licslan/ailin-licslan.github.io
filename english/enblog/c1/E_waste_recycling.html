            Sam, I don't know what to do with my old phones.
            <br>
            Whatever you do, don't toss them. E-waste is extremely hazardous (有害的) to the
            environment.
            <br>
            I've heard. Apparently, if it ends up in landfills, contaminants (污染物) can seep (渗出)
            into the soil (土壤).
            <br>
            Yep, and burning it just creates fine particulate matter (细颗粒物) in the air.
            <br>
            Crazy. Do you ever sell your used electronics to shops that salvage (抢救) the parts?
            <br>
            Yeah, but I'm skeptical (怀疑的) about how much they really benefit the environment.
            Often they just extract (提炼) the precious metals, but other recyclable parts are
            thrown away.
            <br>
            Yikes! Tech companies should incentivize (激励) people to recycle more, like Apple's
            trade-in program.
            <br>
            True, but that's just a drop in the bucket. And with the expansion (扩展) of electric
            vehicles, the e-waste problem will likely get worse.
            <br>
            Hmm... And planned obsolescence (有计划的淘汰) doesn't help either. Phones usually only
            last 2 years.
            <br>
            Right. I feel people would be more inclined (倾向的) to safely dispose of stuff if there
            were more recycling depots (回收站).
            <br>
            Yeah, and just educating people to reduce, reuse and recycle would help.
            <br>
            Personally, I'm in favor of (偏向 支持) a recycling deposit.
