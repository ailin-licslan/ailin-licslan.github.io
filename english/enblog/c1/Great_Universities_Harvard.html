            As one of America's most prestigious lvy League schools, Harvard boasts an
            illustrious lineup of presidential alumni, like JFK and Barack Obama.
            <br>
            However, unbeknownst to someone, the university came from humble beginnings (无名之辈).
            <br>
            Originally founded as "New College" in 1636, it was built to train the clergy (神职人员
            牧师 僧侣) for the new commonwealth.
            <br>
            A few years later, the very first printing press in North America arrived at Harvard,
            aiding its ascendance (优势 权势 支配地位) as a major center for publishing, education and news.
            <br>
            However, in the 1800s, its composition became redefined by the Boston elite (精英), who
            were quickly becoming the university's main benefactors (赞助人).
            <br>
            Attendance became a rite of passage for those wishing to gain social advantage, and
            admission (准许进入) became more exclusive and mentally arduous (艰巨的).
            <br>
            Around this time and towards the 1900s, the curriculum (教材 课程) became secularized
            (脱离宗教控制的 世俗化的) and broadened to include business and law.
            <br>
            Today, Harvard ranks amongst the world's top 5 institutes for medicine, business and
            law.
            <br>
            Interestingly, the school's most famous statue of John Harvard is in fact erroneous.
            <br>
            Despite its description, Harvard was not "the founder", but rather a benefactor who
            bequeathed (把...遗赠给) his private library and land to the school.
