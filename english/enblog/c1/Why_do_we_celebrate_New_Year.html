            Hey, Paul!, It's almost midnight!
            <br>
            Exciting! You know, don't you wonder why January 1st is when we mark the New Year?
            <br>
            Actually, it goes back to the Roman consuls(执政官;永久债券). Their terms began on January
            1st, signifying(代表;预示) the start of the year.
            <br>
            Wow, that was sure lost to the sands of time(时间的流逝)! Now it's purely
            ceremonial(仪式的;正式的;礼仪的).
            <br>
            That's okay. Cultural artifacts like this bring meaning to our past and present
            relationships.
            <br>
            Reminds me of the New Year's song Auld Lang Syne:reminiscing(追忆) about old times with
            friends, closing a chapter of life.
            <br>
            And opening another! Temporal landmarks help us plan for the future.
            <br>
            Ah, like a birthday. We see our future selves as distinct from the present.
            <br>
            Exactly, so it gives us the pretense of control to ease anxiety and motivate us to be
            better.
            <br>
            Pretense or not, 2020 was a doozy(不同寻常的 通常指不好的事情), so I'm ready to wipe the slate
            clean(重新开始)!
            <br>
            At least until we break our New Year's resolutions!
            Touché! Oh, and Happy New Year!
