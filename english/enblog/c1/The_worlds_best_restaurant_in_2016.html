            "The World's 50 Best Restaurant" is a list produced by a British magazine, Restaurant, based on a poll of international chefs, food
            critic, and gourmands (美食家).
            <br>
            The top restaurants are often fine dining restaurants and forerunners (先锋 先驱) of molecular gastronomy (分子料理)
            <br>
            The number one restaurant in 2016 is Osteria Francescana in Modena, ltaly.
            <br>
            After two years in the number two spot, chef Massimo Bottura's tranquil (安静的 宁静的) restaurant in a Modena backstreet rightly steps up
            to take the global crown, refecting the chef's creativity, skill, passion, and determination to redefine ltalian cooking.
            <br>
            Style of food: contemporary (当代的) ltalian.
            <br>
            Unusual for such a famous fine dining (高级餐饮) restaurant, it still offers an a` la carte option alongside two tasting menus.
            <br>
            A few highlights: The famous five Ages of Parmigiano Reggiano explores the region's esteemed (地区声誉) cheese via temperature, texture,
            and, of course, taste.
            <br>
            The dining room: Bottura's creations are heavily influenced by art and music(jazz in particular), and three elegant(精致的) rooms that
            make up the dining space are adorned (装饰) with high-quality contemporary artworks.
            <br>
            The price tag: A 9-course tasting menu will set you back 220 euros. But you will need to wait for two years, as Osteria Francescana is fully booked
            until 2017.
