            Welcome to TalkShop. I'm Bruce. How may I help you today?
            <br>
            Hi Bruce. I would like to cancel my cell phone contract.
            <br>
            I am sorry to hear that . What seems to be the problem, ma'am?
            <br>
            My main complaint is that I can't get a cell phone signal in my own house! Besides that, my phone is constantly dropping calls.
            <br>
            We do apologize for that. We are currently upgrading our cell phone towers and expanding coverage city-wide. I see from the address
            on your account that you live in a rural area. This may explain the spotty coverage and dropped calls. How does everything work for you
            when you get closer in to town?
            <br>
            It's slightly better BUt I work from home, so that's where I need to make most of my calls from. I've been having a lot of problems making and
            receiving calls, and it's hurting my business. I don't really have a choice but to cancel the contract.
            <br>
            Ma'am , you signed a two-year contract with TalkShop, If you cancel today, there is a $300 early cancellation fee.
            <br>
            The contract does not fit my present needs. I simply can't make calls, and I need more data and texting options.
            <br>
            I can see where you're coming from, ma'am. But we do have a policy that requires us to charge you a fee for breaking you contract. If you
            want to avoid that, I could look into upgrading your service plan for you. That way, you don't have to pay the early cancellation fee and
            you get a higher level of service.
            <br>
            Not at this time. I understand you policy, but because of poor service I can't use my phone when I need it most. So I would
            appreciate it if you could cancel my contract and waive(放弃) the early cancellation fee for me.
            <br>
            Let me talk to my manager and I'll see what we can do.
            <br>
            Thanks, And I'll also need you to unlock my phone so I can take my business to another carrier(运营商).
