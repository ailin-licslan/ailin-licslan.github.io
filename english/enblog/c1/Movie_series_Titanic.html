            Production of "Titanic" was anything but smooth sailing (一帆风顺). Numerous (许多的 大量的)
            production delays and massive budget overruns threatened to sink the movie before it
            was even released.
            <br>
            Despite these setbacks, the epic film of the unsinkable luxury liner (邮轮) achieved
            significant critical and commercial success, and later received numerous accolades
            (赞誉 赞美).
            <br>
            The film begins with eerie (怪异而令人恐惧的) actual footage of the real Titanic lying in its
            watery grave two and a half miles below the sea.
            <br>
            The dramatic focus is then provided by 101-year-old Rose, a Titanic survivor who
            recounts her own experiences on the maiden voyage (初航) of the doomed (难逃一死的 注定的) ship.
            <br>
            As a teenager, Rose was a precarious(不牢靠的 不稳的) member of high society, whose status
            would be cemented (巩固) by marrying a loathsome (令人憎恶的 令人呕吐的) steel baron (大亨) named Cal.
            <br>
            However, during the voyage she falls desperately in love with Jack, a poor boy of
            whom she promises to never let go.
            <br>
            Titanic the ship is a microcosm (缩影) of class relations and stratification (分层) with
            the upper class in the upper decks (上层甲板) and the lower class restricted to steerage
            (下等舱室).
            <br>
            The film has no shortage of moments juxtaposing (把不同的事物并置 并列) the two classes, chief
            among them being the stuffy rich party followed by the lively poor one.
