            Hey Adam, were you just singing "Boundless Oceans, Vast Skies" by Beyond?
            <br>
            I sure was! I love Cantopop songs. They're the classics in my repertoire(表演曲目).
            <br>
            Amazing! How did you get into it? You must know some Cantonese, right?
            <br>
            Yes. I lived in Guangzhou for a while. That's where I picked up(学会 掌握) some
            Cantonese. And being a musician, belting out(哼唱 大声地唱) Cantonese tunes was the next
            natural step.
            <br>
            What's the appeal of Cantopop to you?
            <br>
            Where do I even begin? It fuses(融合) elements of Western-style pop perfectly with
            Chinese sensibilities(情感), further enhanced by the melodious(旋律悠扬的) nature of Cantonese.
            <br>
            You said it. I came of age(成年的过程) listening to songs by the "Four Heavenly Kings." I
            learned to sing Jacky Cheung's songs even though I'm a Northerner and couldn't speak
            a word of Cantonese!
            <br>
            Totally, Music transcends(超越) linguistic(语言的) barriers. Whether it's fast beats or
            love ballads(抒情歌曲), no one does it like Cantopop!
            <br>
            Who's your favorite singer then?
            <br>
            Talk about a difficult question!
