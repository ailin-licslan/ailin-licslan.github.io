            Hey Carrie, which American talk shows do you like to watch?
            <br>
            There are so many: early morning talk shows, daytime talk shows, late night talk
            shows, big network and cable (有线点视) talk shows.
            <br>
            Wow, that's a lot. I take it they have different formats?
            <br>
            Sure do. Early morning shows, like Good Morning American, usually cover national new
            stories, lifestyle tips and entertainment news.
            <br>
            I see. What about late night talk shows? Are they more comedy-focused?
            <br>
            They sure are. Shows like The Late Show with Stephen Colbert start with a monologue
            that jokes about current events and politics, followed by celebrity guests.
            <br>
            Oh, yeah. I've seen some of those. The celebrity segments are super fun.
            <br>
            Yes. Many Americans also love the satire (讽刺) aspect of late night shows, especially
            when the hosts roast (尖锐批评 吐槽) politicians.
            <br>
            I find those jokes are hard to get though. Actually my favorite is The Ellen Show.
            <br>
            Yeah. Ellen is huge now. But the queen of daytime talk shows was Oparh. Her
            human-interest stories inspired the hearts of millions.
            <br>
            She was the best. I miss her show.
            <br>
            Tell you what I don't miss:"trash TV." Those are talk shows that just have outrageous
            (离谱的) guests who just do and say obscene (骇人听闻的 令人震惊的) things
            <br>
            Uh, I'm glad I've never seen those.
