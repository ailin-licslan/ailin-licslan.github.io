            It seems like there's a podcast for everything these days from journalism to amateur
            reviews.
            <br>
            Tell me about it. The lists are exhaustive (全面的). When it started in the early 2000s,
            it was super geeky and esoteric (只有少数人 一般指内行的 才懂的 难懂的).
            <br>
            Yeah, now it's gone really mainstream. so what spurred (促进 加速) the explosion?
            <br>
            Well, in 2014, podcasts gained traction, appealing (吸引) to listeners with suspense (悬疑)
            and storytelling.
            <br>
            Wasn't that when "Serial" (一个播客节目) emerged (出现) and spawned (催生) a plethora (过多) of
            similar podcasts? It was really intimate and gripping (扣人心弦的 令人全神贯注的)
            <br>
            Yeah! Being able to subscribe to podcasts makes it more personalized and engaging
            (吸引人的) too.
            <br>
            True, and that engagement drives the monetization (赚钱方法).
            <br>
            Speaking of which, China has a really interesting, alternative model.
            <br>
            It's more of a "pay-of-knowledge" model than an ad-driven model,right?
            <br>
            Yeah, people actually pay for content since a lot of it is skill-based.
            <br>
            Hmm... maybe we could start our own podcast and cash in?
            <br>
            Haha! Well I'm not sure if that'll work here, but it can't hurt to try.
