            Hey James, you bought your Halloween stuff yet?
            <br>
            No, not yet, I'll probably end up scrambling around to buy everything last minute.
            <br>
            There's still time! I went to a thrift store this year to cut down on spending.
            <br>
            That's smart. I miss the days when it wasn't so commercialized.
            <br>
            You know Halloween is now the second largest spending holiday after Christmas?
            <br>
            I'm not surprised. I read last year retailers raked in over $9 billion selling Halloween
            products.
            <br>
            Well, we do live in a consumerist society these days. Everyone is too preoccupied with
            work to make things themselves.
            <br>
            That's true. People prefer buying costumes and candy they see in movies or on TV.
            <br>
            Yeah, and decorations have gotten more excessive. People really splurge on those.
            <br>
            Yup, Halloween is really trending away from its traditional, religious roots.
            <br>
            It's all a bit much for me. But I don't blame people for wanting to have fun.
            <br>
            Yeah. Well, personally, I have just as much fun without all the spending.
