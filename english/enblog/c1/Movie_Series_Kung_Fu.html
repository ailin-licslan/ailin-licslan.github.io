            Stephen Chow is often compared to Charlie Chaplin, and his nonsensical (愚蠢的 荒谬的) "mou
            lei tau" with Chaplin's slapstick (打闹剧 滑稽剧).
            <br>
            Indeed, their films often tell a similar story: the underdog(弱者 弱势群体) with a heart of
            gold who overcomes the odds and wins the day.
            <br>
            "Kung Fu Hustle" is the story of an aspiring gangster, who tries to extort (敲诈 勒索) a
            small community in Old Shanghai called "Pig Sty Alley".
            <br>
            However, unbeknownst (在某人不知道的情况下) to Sing, Pig Sty Alley is the home to several kung
            fu masters who are able to repel (击退 抗御) both Sing and the murderous Axe Gang.
            <br>
            During the film's climax (高潮 顶点 极点 层进法) he rises to the heavens, meets the Buddha,
            and returns to defend the community as a kuang fu master himself.
            <br>
            "Kung Fu Hustle" is a tongue-in-cheek (半开玩笑的敬意) to both Eastern and Western cinema.
            <br>
            As one might expect, the choreography (编排设计) of the fight scenes is top-notch,
            Through CGI, many moves from the imagination of martial arts novelist Jin Yong are
            brought to life.
            <br>
            However, it also borrows from American elements as disparate(截然不同的) as "The Matrix"
            and "Looney Tunes".
            <br>
            Serveral kung fu stars have prominent(著名的 显著的 凸出的) roles, and directors Feng Xiaogang
            and Zhang Yibai both have cameos (客串角色 小配角).
