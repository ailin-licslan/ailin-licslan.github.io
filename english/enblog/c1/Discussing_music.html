            Hey Drew, this new up-and-coming (有前途的) Indie (独立的) band is touring (巡回演出), here next
            week. Wanna check it out?
            <br>
            What kind of music do they play?
            <br>
            It's hard to nail them down (弄清 确定) to an exact genre (类型). They're pretty
            eclectic(不拘一格的 兼收并蓄的 博采众长的).
            <br>
            Well help me out here. Is it Rock? R&B? Country? Do they play covers or originals?
            <br>
            Originals. I guess you could call it a jazz hip-hop fusion kind of thing. They've got
            all of the complex harmonies (和声) of jazz, but with hip-hop rhythms (节奏) thrown in
            for good measure (另外 额外).
            <br>
            So do they actually play instruments, or is it all sampling (音乐采样)?
            <br>
            It's a good deal of both. They sample old jazz standards, but add a hip-hop twist (改编).
            The lead singer is a virtuoso (演奏家) sax player.
            <br>
            Sounds neat (好的), but I'm just worried that I wouldn't be able to get into it. I'm a
            Top 40 guy at heart, you know.
            <br>
            Fair enough.
            <br>
            You should ask Jim though; he's really big into experimental (实验主义的) music.
            <br>
            I already did! But he's such a homebody (喜欢宅在家的人). He'd rather sit at home and listen
            to recordings than go to a live venue(场地 举行地点 会场).
            <br>
            Well, I guess I could go then. I haven't been to a concert since 2010, unless you
            count the symphonies (交响乐) my wife drags me to.
            <br>
            Music is music, man. It's the universal language.
