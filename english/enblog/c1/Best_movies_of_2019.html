            Man, there were so many good movies last year!
            <br>
            Oh, I know! I watched all the superhero blockbusters (大片) . But the top 2 were
            probably Avengers: Endgame and Captain Marvel.
            <br>
            Yeah, my favorite dramas were Once Upon A Time in Hollywood, Parasite and the
            arthouse film The Lighthouse.
            <br>
            What did you think of Parasite? It got a lot of Oscar buzz, but I also heard it was
            overrated.
            <br>
            It's totally worth the hype (大肆宣传)! It's a genre-defying film that's both darkly
            comedic and poignant (尖锐的 辛酸的).
            <br>
            Interesting. Got any recommendations for any family dramas too?
            <br>
            Marriage Story! Hands down, it's one of the most heart-wrenching (令人心痛的 让人心碎的) films
            of last year.
            <br>
            Yeah, I heard Scarlett Johansson's performance was absolutely mesmerizing (令人完全沉醉的,
            让人痴迷的 着迷的).
            <br>
            It really was. But, I have to admit, I'm a sucker for tearjerkers(催人泪下的).
            <br>
            Who isn't? My favorite was the Farewell. Being Chinese American I find it really
            relatable.
            <br>
            Well, it certainly helped Asian actors gain ground. I just hope we'll see even more
            diversity this year.
