            I swear, every day there's a new streaming service coming out.
            <br>
            It's true. But companies like Netflix and Hulu have been around for ages. It's funny
            that everyone else is just hopping on the bandwagon (顺应潮流 跟风) now.
            <br>
            Yeah, well the fact that more and more consumers are opting out of (选择不做某事) their
            cable subscriptions for streaming services is causing the film industry to restructure.
            <br>
            That must be why Disney+ and Apple TV+ came out not too long age. I bet traditional
            broadcasting and TV advertising have suffered a huge blow too.
            <br>
            Sure have. Cord-cutting (断线 引申为观众不再看有线电视) has led to drastic (剧烈的 彻底的) shifts in the
            market, which is why telecom giants AT&T and Comcast will be coming out with their
            own streaming services this year too.
            <br>
            Sounds like they're trying to get a piece of the pie (一杯羹) as well. I'm just not sure
            how much more room there is for market penetration (市场渗透).
            <br>
            I agree. I mean who has the time to watch all these new shows, let alone (更不用说) pay for
            all these different services?
            <br>
            You'd be surprised Besides, that's how these companies get you: they hook you in by
            offering original series that are exclusive to their streaming service.
            <br>
            That reminds me. I need to renew my Amazon Video account.
