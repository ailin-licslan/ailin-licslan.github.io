            Hey,Siri. Set an alarm for 6:30 AM tomorrow morning.
            <br>
            Okay. I set an alarm for 6:30 AM.
            <br>
            Boy, speech recognition(语音识别) technology sure has come a long way. Have you ever
            stopped to think about how it works?
            <br>
            Actually, I have. When you trigger Siri by Speaking, you speech is converted from
            audio to its corresponding (相当的 相应的 一致的 通信的) textual form in the back-end of the system.
            <br>
            I see. Developing such software must have been extremely challenging.
            <br>
            And time-consuming. Siri is able to cater to various accents because engineers train
            machine learning models on large transcribed (转录 转写) datasets comprised of voice
            samples from large groups of people.
            <br>
            That's fascinating.
            <br>
            Yeah,but what I find fascinating is that Apple servers run Natural Language
            Processing, or NLP, algorithms to understand the intent of what the user is trying to
            say.
            <br>
            Which enables NLP engines to distinguish exactly what someone is saying.
            <br>
            You got it. But doing so is a mammoth(巨大的) task because of the many different ways
            you can say one thing.
            <br>
            I imagine contextual understanding must be another major aspect of Siri's machine
            learning technology then?
            <br>
            Sure is. That's why more and more we're able to speak to Siri like any other human.
            Hey Siri, play "Yellow Submarine" by the Beatles.
