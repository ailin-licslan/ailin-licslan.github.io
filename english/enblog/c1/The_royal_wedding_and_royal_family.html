            Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are family tying the knot. Marrying an actress is
            no surprise, but I never thought I'd see an American join the Royal Family.
            <br>
            I guess you could say this is just another form of globalization, Winston. I say,
            since Harry is known as the Prince of Wales, what will Meghan's title be after they
            get married?
            <br>
            That's a good question, Reginald. I heard that she will be regarded as a duchess and
            a princess.
            <br>
            Two titles at once? And what's a duchess?
            <br>
            A duchess is the female equivalent of a duke, old boy.
            <br>
            Wait, so what's the difference between a duke and prince?
            <br>
            According to European nobility, a duke is the highest rank below the monarch.
            For example, Harry's father, Charles, Duke of Cornwall, is next in line to the
            British throne.
            <br>
            But he is also a prince; this is making my head spin.So, are all princes and princesses
            both dukes and duchesses?
            <br>
            No, since the Queen must first grant a royal dukedom, there are Windsors who have yet to
            receive this title.
            <br>
            Gosh, I never knew the aristocracy was so complex!
