            Chris,I'm thinking of buying an electric car.Mind if I pick your brain(请教,询问建议)?
            <br>
            No, go ahead. Now is a great time to buy one, especially if you factor in the tax
            incentives(税收优惠).
            <br>
            Yeah, that really drives down the cost. How do you like being an EV owner?
            <br>
            I love it! the driving range isn't the best, but for city driving it's great.
            <br>
            I guess charging can be a bit of an inconvenience. How long does that take?
            <br>
            The short answer is long. But battery technology is improving, and there are more
            charging stations popping up every day.
            <br>
            Maybe it's time I take the plunge(冒险试试). I really care about sustainability and
            renewable energy these days.
            <br>
            Me too. I'd recommend a Tesla. Their new model is sleeker, has a longer battery life
            and has great handing.
            <br>
            They're cool, but I'm leaning towards something on the cheaper side.
            <br>
            Well, if you want a new EV with all the built-in features, it's going to be pricey.
            <br>
            It doesn't need to be self-driving or anything Even a hybrid(混合动力车) will do.
            <br>
            I see. Well, you should go take one for a test drive.
