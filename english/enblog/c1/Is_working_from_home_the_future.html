            Hey, Matt. I heard your new job lets you work remotely.
            <br>
            Yeah, I'm loving it. It's great having flexibility and autonomy (自主) over my work.
            <br>
            That's great! Isn't it hard without face-to-face interactions, though?
            <br>
            We mitigate (缓和) that pretty well by leveraging (利用) collaboration tools we already
            had, like Slack and Zoom.
            <br>
            That's cool. Weren't you more productive in an office?
            <br>
            Not at all. Offices have lots of productivity constraints (约束). And, since we're
            judged only on our output, it actually keeps people from slacking off (偷懒 懈怠).
            <br>
            Interesting. I still like the camaraderie (友情 同事情谊) you get from being with coworkers.
            <br>
            As long as you like your coworkers! We do have a physical office we can visit, and we
            have team-building retreats (修养处 撤退 放弃 离开) as well.
            <br>
            Seems like you they're working out the kinks (phr.解决问题). I can definitely see that it
            lets companies tap into a far bigger global talent pool.
            <br>
            For sure. Insofar as they can, more and more companies are exploring this or some
            hybrid (混合物) of it.
            <br>
            I think it's going to look like a different world in ten years!
