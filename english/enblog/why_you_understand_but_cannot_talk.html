            Sometimes I will find we can understand the other people speaking but can't speak just
            like him/her, why? except you are just a language beginner, have less opportunity of
            practicing english with other people. what if you have been studying english so many
            years and will still keep learning , you just feel there a barrier to you to improve
            your english. i guess there several reason for us feeling like this.
            because we can't use english every day, not like we use our mother tongue almost
            every day in our life. so we should create an environment for ourselves. you can wake
            up early just like we need to eat breakfast we should listen english every day, try
            to speak to yourself and find resource from website such as bilibili / YouTube etc.
            and record your voice, and listen that again and again try find not correct and then
            to fix it day by day. which means we should combine input and output together to
            train our self.
            Cultivate a habit is very important, sometimes maybe we should force our self to do
            the thing we don't like at first, once we get used to it and insist doing that for a
            long time, you will find it's definitely will make you feel better. that's the habit
            how we create. just start to do it have no hesitation and continuous do that never
            give up!
